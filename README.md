*Hands-On Machine Learning Notes and Solutions*
This repository contains my personal notes and solutions for exercises from the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron. The content covers a range of machine learning topics, including fundamental concepts, practical implementations, and in-depth exercises.

Feel free to explore, use the notes for study, and adapt the solutions to your own projects or learning needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
